          <h2>Matthew LeBlanc</h2>
          <p>Hello there! I'm Matt LeBlanc, 'yes, just like Joey Tribbiani'. I moved to Seattle about 3 years ago in pursuance of being a culinary prospect in which I had started as a dishwasher. Through two years of observing, analyzing, and learning, I had found my way up the ranks and landed as a sous chef. Then came to the conclusion that I'm not entirely interested as the culinary field being a career, it's more of a hobby I enjoy. I don't have a lot of experience in coding prior to this class, just Java class I had taken one semester in high school. But I had really enjoyed it, so I figured I would try out computer programming. Now, looking at where I am now, given the fact that I had started fresh, I am confident that through observing, analyzing, and learning, I will be a very proficient developer.</p>

          <h2>Nick Gibson</h2>
          <p>Nick is a current student at Code Fellows. His past experiences include running and consulting on various political campaigns across the state of Washington, dozens of job titles and roles across the University of Washington's administration, and most recently, serving you stronger-than-expected drinks alongside his questionable charm at a number of local bars. He's pursing a burgeoning interest in coding in order to achieve a position as a developer, thus fitting in in his beloved hometown of Seattle even better. His personal interests are pinball, old Honda motorbikes, and cursing his undying love of the Seattle Sounders when they let him down.</p>

          <h2>Adrian Hawk  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/adrianhawk" target=_"blank"><img src="img/linkedin.png" alt="LinkedIn" height="45px"></a></h2>
          <p>My original backgound comes in the form of Bartending (a distant memory) and serving in the U. S. NAVY. My service had numerous roles ~ OPERATIONS - ANALYST - INSTRUCTOR - LAW ENFORCEMENT - VBSS TEAMS. After I left the military, I took a position as an IT at the Tri-Lakes Board of REALTORS in SW Missouri. Then took on a role as an IT for HomeServices of America (A Berkshire Hathaway Affiliate) managing 5 offices in the Table Rock Lake area of SW Missouri. While helping REALTORS with their websites and building a couple for them, as well, I found I wanted to switch careers. I moved to the NW to surround myself in the Web Dev world and completed an Associate of Applied Science in Web Dev and Design in Portland. Now, I'm here at Code Fellows to get serious about coding.</p>
